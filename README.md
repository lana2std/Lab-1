# Lab 1: Git & GitHub for ML Projects

### Hi, I am Lana AlQahtani!

I am currently a student majoring in Computer Science. I have always had a passion for technology and coding, and I am particularly interested in machine learning and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. In my spare time, I enjoy working on coding projects and exploring new AI tools.

Looking forward to learning more about machine learning in ARTI 308!
